# pid-control-ball-position-1-axis

This project was for my final in 6.320.  We made a beam out of legos which balances a ball at a desired location using a servo to control the angle of the beam and an optical range finder to provide the ball's current location.  In this directory is the arduino script used and the final report detailing our dynamics and controller models, parameter selection methods, and noise filtering algorithms.
